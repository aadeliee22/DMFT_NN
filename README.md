# Introduction
This page is for 'Machine learning prediction of metal-insulator transition in DMFT'
1. `0_toy_ising`: For toy problem of predicting order/disorder 2nd phase transition
2. `1_dmftsolver`: DMFT code & data
3. `2_nn`: Every important things are here. To see briefly, go to [`/2-nn/4_makefigure.ipynb`](https://github.com/aadeliee22/Hubbard_NN/blob/master/2_nn/4_makefigure.ipynb).
